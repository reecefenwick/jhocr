# Code Format #

Be sure to check your code before checking the code. Only functional code and formatted code:
  * Use our eclipse-code-formatter-profile.xml see [r24](https://code.google.com/p/jhocr/source/detail?r=24)
  * No @author tag needed, see [Apache removes author tag](http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1037207/apache-enforces-the-removal-of-author-tags) and [Javadoc @author tag good practices](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17269843/javadoc-author-tag-good-practices)
  * When to commit? Commit only when you have successfully unit tested the given function/module/functionality and you are reasonably assured that it is ready for integration or system testing, see:  [When to commit code?](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/83837/when-to-commit-code)
